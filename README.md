# McKinley-Library-and-Museum-App

The McKinley Library and Museum App is a mobile app that provides information about the McKinley Museum to the public. All users can access a gallery in the app to learn more about the museum by viewing specific museum images and drone footage. Additionally, users may create user accounts to access more features, such as a store to purchase museum memberships and to receive notifications of upcoming events and special promotions[^1]. Users with an account can also maintain their museum memberships from within the app[^2]. Lastly, museum members can access their unique QR code within the app to scan in at the museum for museum access[^3].

Nothing confidential will be shown in this repo. Again, the final app for this project will act as a template for the final product.

[^1]: This feature may not be fully fleshed out due to poor communication with the McKinley Presidential Library and Museum.
[^2]: Due to no access to the user database used by the Museum and their payment system, this will be shown through a "demo" or "template."
